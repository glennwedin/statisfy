# Simple isomorphic react-boilerplate

Trying to understand isomorphic webapps and tired of "Simple boilerplates" with 200 MB of code?
This is a REALLY simple boilerplate with as few confusing elements as possible. The entire applications code lies under /src. Uses react, react-router and express.
Build the client and server with webpack using "npm build".



## Start

### Run

```
1. npm install
2. npm build
3. npm start
4. open browser at localhost:3000

```
